    32位
    bool           = 1
    char           = 1
    unsigned char  = 1
    short          = 2
    unsigned short = 2
    int            = 4
    unsigned int   = 4
    long           = 4
    unsigned long  = 4
    long long      = 8
    float          = 4
    double         = 8
    long double    = 8
    指针           = 4


    64位
    bool           = 1
    char           = 1
    unsigned char  = 1
    short          = 2
    unsigned short = 2
    int            = 4
    unsigned int   = 4
    long           = 4
    unsigned long  = 4
    long long      = 8
    float          = 4
    double         = 8
    long double    = 8
    指针           = 8


    引用变量所占空间与被引用变量相同
